    "text": "Intro : My undergraduate experience gave me a good understanding of the software development lifecycle and an appreciation for beautifully written code. Working in the financial industry for Citi I further developed these skills and realized my ability to build and scale enterprise applications. I then moved to Northern Labs, as an opportunity to work for a smaller company with less bureacracy and spend more time building and learning from talented senior engineers.\nWorking with large quantities of data at both Citi and my current Northern Labs, I most enjoyed the time I spent performing adhoc analysis of the data I was using to build applications on top of. Spending extra hours chatting with the quantitative engineers about potential uses of data, I realized my real passion was in Data Science, and the application development was more of a distraction. With that in mind - as well as a growing distaste for the financial field and a burning desire to move to the West Coast - I pursued a masters in data science at UBC, in order to develop my data analysis skills and apply them to a field I’m more passionate about. My current passion is public health - I believe healthcare should be affordable and accessible to all and am excited to work for companies that are aligned with that goal."

I also worked on a real-time pricing and volatility engine used as input for the trading engine. Additionally I spent time redesigning the authentication platform for the trading engine.\n\n\nSenior Software Developer (Citi, Mississauga ON)\n(June 2019 - July 2022)\nI joined Citi as part of their rotational program on the Loans team, where I overhauled the CI/CD system they used to deploy components for managing loans. I then worked as lead on the initial development of an ETL framework to move customer and transaction data to a new system (LoanIQ).\nAfter a year I moved to the ISG team where I worked on a real-time trade analysis software, developing a tool using Storm and Spark to consume client orders for analysis. I led development efforts when we migrated the analysis to using a database (Kinetica) - developing SQL scripts and working closely with the business and database client teams to resolve technical issues.\n\n\nProgramming Intern (Ontario Financing Authority, Toronto ON)\n(May 2017 - Aug 2018)\nDuring this internship I worked on developing financial software for use by internal clients, writing SQL scripts and working with C#. I also developed a tool for HR to use during the onboarding and offboarding process."
