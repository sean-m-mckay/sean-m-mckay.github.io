I also worked on a real-time pricing and volatility engine used as input for the trading engine. Additionally I spent time redesigning the authentication platform for the trading engine.\n\n\nSenior Software Developer (Citi, Mississauga ON)\n(June 2019 - July 2022)\nI joined Citi as part of their rotational program on the Loans team, where I overhauled the CI/CD system they used to deploy components for managing loans. I then worked as lead on the initial development of an ETL framework to move customer and transaction data to a new system (LoanIQ).\nAfter a year I moved to the ISG team where I worked on a real-time trade analysis software, developing a tool using Storm and Spark to consume client orders for analysis. I led development efforts when we migrated the analysis to using a database (Kinetica) - developing SQL scripts and working closely with the business and database client teams to resolve technical issues.\n\n\nProgramming Intern (Ontario Financing Authority, Toronto ON)\n(May 2017 - Aug 2018)\nDuring this internship I worked on developing financial software for use by internal clients, writing SQL scripts and working with C#. I also developed a tool for HR to use during the onboarding and offboarding process."
