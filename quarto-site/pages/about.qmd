## Work Experience

#### Software Developer (Northern Labs, Toronto ON)
(Sept 2022- Aug 2023)

During my year at Northern Labs I led the development of a Market Data ingestion pipeline for storing data that quantitative analysts could use for backtesting their trading strategies. I also worked on a real-time pricing and volatility engine used as input for the trading engine. Additionally I spent time redesigning the authentication platform for the trading engine.

#### Senior Software Developer (Citi, Mississauga ON)
(June 2019 - July 2022)

I joined Citi as part of their rotational program on the Loans team, where I overhauled the CI/CD system they used to deploy components for managing loans. I then worked as lead on the initial development of an ETL framework to move customer and transaction data to a new system (LoanIQ).

After a year I moved to the ISG team where I worked on a real-time trade analysis software, developing a tool using Storm and Spark to consume client orders for analysis. I led development efforts when we migrated the analysis to using a database (Kinetica) - developing SQL scripts and working closely with the business and database client teams to resolve technical issues.

#### Programming Intern (Ontario Financing Authority, Toronto ON)
(May 2017 - Aug 2018)

During this internship I worked on developing financial software for use by internal clients, writing SQL scripts and working with C#. I also developed a tool for HR to use during the onboarding and offboarding process. 

## Hobbies and Interests
![](../img/outdoor.jpg){fig-align="center" class="whoami-page-image"}

I try to spend as much time as possible away from the keyboard outside. My current interests are running, rock climbing and backcountry skiing - I'm trying to dabble in mountaineering. When I am forced indoors by weather or other extenuating circumstances I enjoy reading and playing board games.
